This directory contains documentation about the structure and contents
of the Viking GCMS raw and reduced binary data files, and a set of
analysis script to decode and view their contents.

Status:
-------

All three file formats (reduced, Viking-1 and Viking-2 raw) have been
reverse engineered, their structure is documented and there is (or will
be) a working decoder for each format. The relationship between the two
kinds of files is mostly understood, it is possible to derive the
reduced data from the raw.

However, the files contain several sets of engineering parameters that
we don't know how to identify or interpret. There is an important
auxiliary instrument parameter (the effluent divider number) that would
be needed for correct interpretation of the measurement data, but it
can't be inferred from the known fields in the headers.

Files:
------

 * file_formats.txt
   Human-readable text with reverse engineered information about file
   structure

 * correspondence.txt
   Tables that link sample run ids and file names

 * decode_reduced_dataset.pl
 * decode_v1_raw.pl
 * decode_v2_raw.pl (TODO)
   Script to decode one file from the reduced, Viking-1 raw, and
   Viking-2 raw datasets, respectively (there are three separate
   decoders because the file formats are completely different).
   Prints result as a tab separated file (with some header information
   prefixed with '#' characters) on the standard output.
   There are alternative output formats and modes to extract engineering
   data from the file/record headers.
   Use the --help option for more information.

 * interactive.plt
   gnuplot script for viewing spectrograms interactively. See below.

 * plot_all_files.sh
   Shell script to create an SVG plot from all files, all mass numbers
   and all scans.

 * draw_mass_spectrogram.plt
 * draw_time_evolution.plt
 * files.plt
   gnuplot scripts designed to be included to the interactive and batch
   plotters, not really useful on their own.

Usage:

To just decode all the files (currently only from the reduced dataset),
just run `make`.

To create plots in batch mode, run `make spectrograms`.
Warning: this takes several minutes and creates several thousand files.

To view mass spectrograms interactively, run the following commands:

	make
	gnuplot

then on the `gnuplot>` prompt, type `load 'interactive.plt'`.

In the plot window press the down and up arrow keys to switch to the
previous or next file, or press the left and right arrow keys to view
the previous or next scan in the current file.
Press the 'm' key to switch between mass spectrogram and time evolution
mode.
Press 'l' to toggle log scale on the vertical axis.

Prerequisites: perl, gnuplot (at least version 5.0), make, bash, awk
