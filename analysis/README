This directory contains documentation about the structure and contents
of the Viking GCMS raw and reduced binary data files, and a set of
analysis script to decode and view their contents.

Files:

 * file_formats.txt
   Human-readable text with reverse engineered information about file
   structure

 * correspondence.txt
   Tables that link sample run ids and file names

 * decode_reduced_dataset.pl
   Script to decode one file from the reduced dataset, prints result as
   a tab separated file (with some header information prefixed with
   '#' characters) on standard output.
   Use the --help option for more information.

 * interactive.plt
   gnuplot script for viewing spectrograms interactively. See below.

 * plot_all_files.sh
   Shell script to create an SVG plot from all files, all mass numbers
   and all scans.


To just decode all the files (currently only from the reduced dataset),
just run `make`.

To create plots in batch mode, run `make spectrograms`.
Warning: this takes several minutes and creates several thousand files.

To view mass spectrograms interactively, run the following commands:

	make
	gnuplot

then on the `gnuplot>` prompt, type `load 'interactive.plt'`.

In the plot window press the down and up arrow keys to switch to the
previous or next file, or press the left and right arrow keys to view
the previous or next scan in the current file.
Press the 'm' key to switch between mass spectrogram and time evolution
mode.

Prerequisites: perl, gnuplot (at least version 5.0), make, bash, awk
