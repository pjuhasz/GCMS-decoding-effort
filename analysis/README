This directory contains documentation about the structure and contents
of the Viking GCMS raw and reduced binary data files, and a set of
analysis scripts to decode and view their contents.

Status:
-------

All three file formats (reduced, Viking-1 and Viking-2 raw) have been
reverse engineered, their structure is documented and there is a working
decoder for each format. The relationship between the two kinds of files
is mostly understood, it is possible to derive the reduced data from
the raw.

However, the files contain several sets of engineering parameters that
we don't know how to identify or interpret. There is an important
auxiliary instrument parameter (the effluent divider number), that would
be needed for correct interpretation of the measurement data, and a few
others that would be good to know, but they can't be inferred from the
known fields in the headers.

It is not known why the V1 and V2 raws are in a completely different
format. All three formats have quirks and inconsistencies that are hard
to explain. In general, very little is known about the original data
reduction and archival process.

Files:
------

 * file_formats.txt
   Human-readable text with reverse engineered information about file
   structure

 * correspondence.txt
   Tables that link sample run ids and file names

 * decode_reduced.pl
 * decode_v1_raw.pl
 * decode_v2_raw.pl
   Scripts to decode one file from the reduced, Viking-1 raw, and
   Viking-2 raw datasets, respectively (there are three separate
   decoders because the file formats are completely different).
   Print result as a tab separated file (with some header information
   prefixed with '#' characters) on the standard output.
   There are alternative output formats and modes to extract engineering
   data from the file/record headers.
   Use the --help option for more information.

 * interactive.plt
   gnuplot script for viewing spectrograms interactively. See below.

 * plot_all_files.sh
   Shell script to create an SVG plot from all files, all mass numbers
   and all scans.

 * draw_mass_spectrogram.plt
 * draw_time_evolution.plt
 * files.plt
   gnuplot scripts designed to be included to the interactive and batch
   plotters, not really useful on their own.

Usage:

To just decode all the files, just run `make`.

To extract the engineering data from the scan headers instead, run
`make headers`.

To create plots in batch mode, run `make spectrograms`.
Warning: this takes several minutes and creates several thousand files.

To view mass spectrograms interactively, run the following commands:

	make
	gnuplot

then on the `gnuplot>` prompt, type `load 'interactive.plt'`.

In the plot window press the down and up arrow keys to switch to the
previous or next file, or press the left and right arrow keys to view
the previous or next scan in the current file.
Press the 'm' key to switch between mass spectrogram and time evolution
mode.
Press 'l' to toggle log scale on the vertical axis.


Prerequisites:
To run just the decoder scripts, only a basic Perl installation is
required (core modules, Perl version >= 5.10).

To be able to use the Makefile, GNU make is and a bash-compatible shell
is required.

To use the gnuplot scripts (either in interactive or batch mode), you
need gnuplot (at least version 5.0), and awk.
